# Elements for a Last-Mile Delivery Simulation

This document outlines the essential elements for a simulation environment designed to study hybrid last-mile delivery systems, combining human couriers and Autonomous Delivery Robots (ADRs).

## I. Environment: Dense Urban City (e.g., Berlin)

1.  **Road Network:**

    - Detailed road network data from OpenStreetMap (OSM).
    - Accurate representation of streets, intersections, sidewalks, and bike lanes.
    - Road attributes like speed limits, traffic directions, and road types.

2.  **Buildings and Obstacles:**

    - Building footprints and heights for realistic 3D representation.
    - Obstacles like trees, streetlights, and parked cars.

3.  **Traffic:**

    - Dynamic traffic simulation with varying densities and flow patterns.
    - Different vehicle types (cars, buses, trucks, bicycles) with realistic behaviors.
    - Simulation of traffic signals and pedestrian crossings.

4.  **Delivery Locations:**
    - Realistic distribution of customer locations (residential, commercial).
    - Clustering of delivery locations to simulate demand hotspots.

## II. Agents

1.  **Human Couriers:**

    - Different courier types (on foot, bicycle, motorcycle, van).
    - Varying speeds, capacities, and operating costs.
    - Realistic behaviors like obeying traffic rules and navigating sidewalks.

2.  **Trucks:**

    - Traditional delivery trucks for potential replenishment or as mobile hubs for ADRs.
    - Varying sizes and capacities.

3.  **Autonomous Delivery Robots (ADRs):**
    - Different types of ADRs (sidewalk, road-based) with varying speeds, ranges, and capacities.
    - Navigation algorithms for path planning and obstacle avoidance.
    - Battery life and charging behavior.

## III. Delivery Operations

1.  **Order Generation:**

    - Dynamic order generation with varying origins, destinations, and time windows.
    - Order priorities and types (e.g., size, weight, fragility).

2.  **Task Allocation:**

    - Dynamic allocation of orders to human couriers or ADRs based on real-time conditions and agent capabilities.

3.  **Dispatching and Routing:**
    - Algorithms for efficient routing and scheduling of both human couriers and ADRs.
    - Consideration of traffic conditions, delivery time windows, and agent constraints.

## IV. AI Integration

1.  **Demand Forecasting:**

    - AI model (e.g., LSTM) for predicting future demand patterns.

2.  **AI Solver (Optional):**
    - Graph-based neural network or other AI approach for optimizing routing and delivery decisions.

## V. Data and Metrics

1.  **Data Collection:**

    - Collect data on delivery times, distances, energy consumption, and other relevant metrics.

2.  **Performance Evaluation:**
    - Use metrics like average delivery time, total cost, success rate, and customer satisfaction to evaluate the efficiency of the hybrid system.
